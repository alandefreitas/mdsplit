# Hiding sections from docs

Use the comments `<!-- START mdsplit-ignore -->` and `<!-- END mdsplit-ignore -->` to ignore sections from your README.md. For instance, if you're reading this from [`README.md`](https://github.com/alandefreitas/mdsplit/blob/master/README.md) you will see this section has a subsection that will be completely ignored in the documentation.
