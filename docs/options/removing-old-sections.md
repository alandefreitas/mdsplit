# Removing old sections

In principle, `mdsplit` will not remove any files in your documentation directory. It will only create or update files. This is meant to allow auxiliary files that you also want to be part of the documentation.

However, that also means that if you change your section names in `README.md`, `mdsplit` will create a new file for this section and the old file would be left untouched. Your GitHub pages would then show you the new and old sections. 

If this is not an auxiliary file you want in your documentation, you need to remove these files. 

To make it easier to identify external auxiliary files, after saving the new markdown files, `mdsplit` will look for any `.md` files in the `docs` directory. If there are any files not generated by `mdsplit`, it will emit a message like the following:

```
# The following .md files were not generated by mdsplit
# Please make sure that is on purpose:
Outsider doc file: docs/README.md
Outsider doc file: docs/COMPLETE_GALLERY.md
``` 

If any of these files contain a comment indicating that `mdsplit` generated the file, then `mdsplit` might automatically remove the file. You can control this behaviour with the `--erase-old-mdsplit-files` (or `-e`) option. The default value is `true` so you need `--erase-old-mdsplit-files=false` to turn it off.
