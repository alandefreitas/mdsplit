# Input file

The `--input` (or `-i`) option defines the file `mdsplit` should split to generate the documentation. You don't usually
want to change the default from `README.md` because that's the file GitHub uses for all repositories.

However, it might be useful to use another file as input if you want to have your documentation in a bulky markdown file
kept separate from your main `README.md`.
