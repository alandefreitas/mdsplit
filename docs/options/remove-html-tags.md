# Remove HTML Tags

The `--clear-html` (or `-d`) option defines the HTML tags `mdsplit` should remove from your `README.md`. This is useful to `README.md` files that use tags such as `details` and `summary` to emulate what the documentation would look like inside the `README.md` file.  

By default, `mdsplit` will remove the tags `details` and `summary` because 1) Jekyll themes often have difficulty with these tags and 2) people often use these tags in markdown files to emulate what the documentation would look like.
