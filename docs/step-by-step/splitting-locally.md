# Splitting Locally

After [installing](../installing/binaries.md) `mdsplit`, run

```bash
mdsplit -r username/repository
```

from your project root directory to generate your documentation.

`mdsplit` will split your `README.md` file into smaller files and save the results to the `docs` directory.

!!! note This is directory from where mkdocs will later build your documentation.
