# Caveats

`mdsplit` will not delete any old files in your documentation directory. It only creates or updates files. This is meant to allow auxiliary files that you also want to be part of the documentation.

However, that also means that if you change your section names in `README.md`, `mdsplit` will create a new file for this section and the old file will be left untouched. 

If this is not an auxiliary file you want in your documentation, you have to manually remove these files. To make it easier to identify external auxiliary files, after saving the new markdown files, `mdsplit` will look for any `.md` files in the `docs` directory. 

If there are any files not generated by `mdsplit`, it will emit the following message:

```
# The following .md files were not generated by mdsplit
# Please make sure that is on purpose:
Outsider doc file: docs/README.md
Outsider doc file: docs/COMPLETE_GALLERY.md
```
